# Top 250 Games

A checklist for GameRankings.com Top 250 Games

Go [there](https://mrthingus.github.io/top-250-games/)

Some basic rules:

# Sports Games

All major sports game franchises (<i>FIFA</i>, <i>NBA</i>, <i>NHL</i>) have been culled.
I'm not discrediting them as real games but rather that they end up bloating the list.

# Remakes

If the remake of a game (i.e. <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>) scores higher than the original version, the original version is culled.
If the original version still scores higher than the remake, both versions stay.

# Editions

The same games are tracked independently of each system (GTA V released on PS3, 360, PC, PS4 and X1). Only the version that scores the highest (GTA V on PS3) counts, everything else is culled.
